   | Selected Topic   |  IPO Analysis  | 
   | :--- | :--- |
   | **Reason why this topic was selected** | 1. Personal interest <br/> 2. Availability of data source <br/> 3. Discover how the global pandemic affected IPO listing |
   | **Questions hoping to answer** | 1. What is the proportion of each sector? <br/> 2.Which industries have the best and worst return in 2019 and 2020? <br/> 3. How has the appetite for IPOs in each sector changed? How did they performed over the years from 2000 to 2020? <br/> 4. How can you benefit from the above information?

  ## Machine Learning Model

  #### Model Choices

  #### Training/Testing Split

- During Training/Testing our models, the highest accuracy found for both Three Month Return and First Day Closing Price was found when using a 67% training and 33% testing split

 #### Model Selection

- Since we have labeled data, we've tried using a variety of different binary classification models:
    - Logistic Regression

   - Random Forest
<img src="https://github.com/reinalim/FinalProject_IPO/blob/Develop/ML_Model/images/random.png" width="80%">

   - Deep Learning
    - Using all our 10 features, our models performed:
        - **Three Month Return model: Current Accuracy 71%**
        - **First Day Closing Price model: Current Accuracy 65%**

## Analysis Results Recap
* Stock marketâ€™s appetite for IPOs is not affected by the recent economic downturn in 2020.
* First Day Returns are positively correlated with Gross Profit Margin while negatively correlated with Cash Flow from Investment (The higher the investment spent, the stronger the First Day Return).
* 3 Month Returns are positively correlated with EBITDA.
* Indeed, Gross Profit Margin, Cash Flow from Investment, and EBITDA turned out to be the most important features in our models, which returned an accuracy of 65% and 71% respectively.
* Our models were better at predicting Gains than Losses, as Gains had better precision and recall scores than Losses, for both the First Day Return and Three-Month Return.

## Recommendation for Future Analysis

#### To obtain data with higher quality:
* The extent of our analysis is partly limited by the quality and incompleteness of our data as we were only able to obtain sufficient quarterly financial information from Alpha Vantage  for 15%  of the original listing of IPOs.
* Therefore, there were not enough high quality data to perform meaningful statistical analysis to uncover trends in the relationship between Returns and various financial metrics.
