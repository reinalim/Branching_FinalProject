## 1. Self-Assessment
- For segment one, I played the square role that was responsible for setting up the group's centralized repository that includes naming the repository, and creating sub-branches, and additing team memebers. 
The team member in the square role will be responsible for setting up the repository.

- For segment two, I played the circle role that was responsible for refining the analysis on README - Github, and generating three images to use in the presentation and with the dashboard.

- For segment three, I played the square role that was responsible for finishing up peer reviews, checking up codes, merging branches and making sure the repository is ready for public view. I also played partial triangle role that was responsible for creating draft version for Google Slides, and the rest our team members also pitched in to create all the slides as team efforts.
Also, creating Tableau story to be ready for Google slides. 

- For segment four, I played the square and partial triangle role that was responsible for finalizing the README that covers the overview of the group project. I also created Tableau Dashboard and added the screenshots of dashboard on Google Slides to demonstrate the visualization part of the project. 

- The greatest personal challenge that I've overcome was the technical difficulties I faced throughout the project, and amount of time that required to put in to complete each segment. The first two weeks, our group faced a lot of technical difficulties and had some challenges of finding reliable dataset for our topic. 

## 2. Team Assessment
- We established our communication protocols early on, we used Slack as our main channel of communication and hosted Zoom meetings 2 times a week, and emergency meetings when one of our team memebers faced technical challenges on their parts.
- The greatest strengths of our team are open communication and effective teamwork. 

## 3. Summary of Project

The machine learning modules we used for our key target features, First Day Return and Three Month Return are logistic egression, random forest.
With our machine learning module accuracy of 65% (First Day Return) and 71% (Three Month Return), we are able to showcase whether the selected IPOs would be successful in achieveing a positive return after three months, and this is significant as 3 months is the typical period at which an IPO can be sold back on the market.
